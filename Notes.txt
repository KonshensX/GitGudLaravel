Users should be able to like posts and comment and them
Likes :
Table must have: id, user_id, post_id, timestamps.
Create the migration and the model .
Create the routes for the like and unlike functionalities along with the links to use them.
The like and unlike are working nice.

Comments :
Table must have: id, comment, user_id, post_id, timestamps.
Create the migration and the model .
Create the routes for commenting and deleting the comment.
This is working perfectly fine .
