laravel todo::
upload profile picture and store it in the harddisk (public folder) and update the database (avatar_name).
dispay the profile picture in the dislay page .
display the profile information in the navbar in layout.app => doing.
implement the search funtionality => doing.
 - the search is gone be using the fullname for now.
 - the search results should be in an order by fuck am i even writing here.
display a user profile and the the following data:
-> the user profile informations .
->user posts and likes (and activity) .

link all the urls and stuff everything is a mess right now .
always check for permissions, check if the user is who claims to be .


//4/5/2017
users should be able to like posts and comment and them
likes :
table must have: id, user_id, post_id, timestamps.
create the migration and the model .
create the routes for the like and unlike functionalities along with the links to use them.
the like and unlike are working nice.

comments :
table must have: id, comment, user_id, post_id, timestamps.
create the migration and the model .
create the routes for commenting and deleting the comment.
this is working perfectly fine .

ideas :
it would be better to have a single user table with all the fields in it instead of having a user and profile entities.

//4/6/2017
merging the profile and user tables into one table user
create te migration and add fields .
delete the profile model and replace it by user .
1 - register controller
-----done ------
display the user avatar in the comments section and also posts .

include angular js and shit

change the like button from a form to a link using angular to toggle status => not done yet.

//4/7/2017
load the comments using angular js

//4/8/2017
add the following functionality
create the follow model and migration.
think about it for a minute.
the search is not working properly => done.
what exactly happens when you follow a user:
1- insert into following table
    *- following table structure:
        - id, user_id, followed_id, timestamps,
        => attempt #1
when registering a new user insert name in the fullname as a default the user can change it later to whatever he wants .
if the user doesn't have a profile picture display the default one
get the list of the following of a user and display them in the profile display action.
Should i work on liking the post using angular or on the post attachments (Pictures and Videos).
Attachements table
    id, post_id, attachement_path, timestamps => false
    Create the attachments model
    The attachments_id is actually useless and can get rid off (Make it null for now)
